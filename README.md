# coding-quiz

## Description

My goal with this challenge was to create from scratch a multiple choice quiz with a built in timer and a way to keep/store score. Upon load the user is greeted with a start button that when pressed initiates the quiz. There are 5 total questions and when finished the user will be greeted with a window that reveals their final score and a prompt for a username that will store there personal score in a leaderboard.
